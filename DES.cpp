      How to use :
  
      type :
   
      $ DES -E filename.extension key   (for Encrypting)
      $ DES -D fiename.des key  (for Decrypting)

 -    you require the file to be encrypted along with the key you want 
      to use to encrypt the file.

  -   you require the file to be decrypted along with the key you want
      that was used to encrypt the file with. 

  NOTE :  the encrypted the file has .des extension
          Thus, for decrypting the file should be a .des file
